This is a shoe store website project, i have used Django Framework for a website which is already made with HTML,CSS and JS
I have added functionalities like a user can register, signup and admin of the website can add the new products to the page without doing code.
I have also connected to Postgresql database to store users data and new shoe products that are uploaded by admin. 
I will also add another feature where the user can add a shoe product to cart and he can order the shoe.
